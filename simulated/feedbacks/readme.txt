Ruben Sanchez-Romero, Joseph D. Ramsey, Kun Zhang, Madelyn R. K. Glymour, Biwei Huang, Clark Glymour; Estimating feedforward and feedback effective connections from fMRI time series: Assessments of statistical methods. Network Neuroscience 2019; 3 (2): 274â€“306. doi: https://doi.org/10.1162/netn_a_00061


Synthetic data for 9 cyclic networks (see images/Networks.pdf, or Figure 1 in Sanchez-Romero et al.) and their amplifying and control variants, resulting in 18 cases. 

For each case: 60 individual datasets are provided (data/NetworkX_XX) and corresponding ground truth graphs (ground.truth/NetworkX_XX)
