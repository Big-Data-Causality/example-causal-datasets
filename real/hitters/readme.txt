Got the 'hitters' dataset from here:

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/keeganhines/59974f1ebef97bbaa44fb19143f90bad/raw/d9bcf657f97201394a59fffd801c44347eb7e28d/Hitters.csv

though it is available from many sources.

Changing it to tab delimited format and removing the first column (names), though these may be obtained from the above. Using * for missing salaary values.
